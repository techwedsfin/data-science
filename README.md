Description
Write a Data Science blog post. We have explored crime data from Kaggle and analysed it and derived interpretations from it to answer few questions realted to crime.

Installations
This code runs with Python version 3.x and requires below listed packages
pandas==0.23.3
numpy==1.12.1
matplotlib==2.1.0
seaborn==0.8.1
scikit-learn==0.19.1
folium==0.10.1
Data-set used for this purpose has been Kaggle's crime-in-atlanta-2017 dataset. You can find the data to download here on this link.

Project Motivation
This is an Udacity Nanodegree project. After living in this area for few years and this dataset being not analyzed by many provided a great motivation for me to work on this. I tried to follow the CRISP-DM approach to interpret results and derive conclusions around it for this area like-

-- What kind of crimes are happening ?
-- When are these crimes happening ?
-- Where do these crimes happen?

File Description
ATL_Crimes.ipynb: Notebook containing the data analysis using CRISP-DM.
crime_in_atl_YTD2017.csv: Dataset containing Kaggle's crime-in-atlanta-2017 dataset

Interacting with project
You can run all the cells in sequential manner in jupyter notebook after installing required packages and keeping the dataset in the same directory.

Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
